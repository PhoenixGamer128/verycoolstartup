## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever had a stressful day because of all the things that you had to do, wished that you had a singular place to find your tasks, or simply forgot something you planned on doing weeks in advance? The Simply Planning app allows you to write down the events or activities that you are supposed to do every day! You can color code your events, shift them around when needed, and even share your available times with friends and family! With this app, you can rest assured that you will never forget to those batteries for your TV remote after a long stressful day at work.

### Design

| Main Page | Event Add Page | Add Other User's Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
|![Design image 1](csDesign1.png) | ![Design image 2](csDesign2.png) | ![Design image 3](csDesign3.png)

The design will have a main page with the calendar with buttons changing the page (or as an overlay) for specific actions. Events are color-coded, marked by shapes, to show what type of event it is. The design is to be simple to allow users not be overwhelmed by lots of information


### Key features

- Login as user with all saved information
- Add customizable events to your calendar
- Events can be color-coded for easy finding
- Simplistic design for easy readability
- Share events with friends and family
- See event changes in real time

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will show the basic structure of my startup.
- **CSS** - This will determine how my startup will look, I will make it polished while also simple.
- **React** - This will allow me to update my events in real time such as adding a new event to the calendar when a submit button is clicked upon adding a new event. This will also show different calendars from shared events by different people.
- **Service** - Backend service will add submitted events to the database, pull added events from the database, as well as sharing events with other through idenitfication (like an email address).
- **DB/Login** - This will store user information, such as a login username and password. This will also store events, descriptions, and dates/times.
- **WebSocket** - Changed or added events will reflect between users so that organization is made easier.
